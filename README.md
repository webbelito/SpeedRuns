# SpeedRuns - a World of Warcraft 1.12.1 AddOn

## Description

This addon will current only write a message to the chat when your character levels up. The plan is to add a GUI for you to track it like a common version of a Speed Running tool. However this provides some directions on how you're performing on a level basis.

## Examples

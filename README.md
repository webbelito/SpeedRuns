# SpeedRuns - a World of Warcraft 1.12.1 AddOn

## Description

This addon will current only write a message to the chat when your character levels up. The plan is to add a GUI for you to track it like a common version of a Speed Running tool. However this provides some directions on how you're performing on a level to level basis.

It stores the values on a Race and Class combination meaning that if you play a Tauren Warrior you will have a PB for Tauren Warrior and you'll have another one if you play an Orc Warrior. Of course this includes if you play another class.

## Examples

First character to level up to level 2 as a Tauren Warrior:
